# A<sup>*</sup> Search Algorithm

A visualisation of A<sup>*</sup> search algorithm written in C++ with QT6 as GUI.

## Example

A board is created in the GUI, where you can create a start target, destination target and boundaries/walls as blockades. The algorithm will visualise how it searches the area and finds the shortest path from the start target to the destination target while avoiding blockades.

## How to run
